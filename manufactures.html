        <p>Sri Lanka was an island inhabited by people who have been closely associated
           with nature since ancient times. They depended on the environment for their 
           daily needs and tools. With the technological advancement of mankind, as a 
           result of industrialization, the relationship with nature seemed to gradually
            erode. As a result of that, there was a lot of talk about environmental
             pollution. In the face of this situation, the need for a sustainable
              solution arose. As a result, the theme of eco-friendly products came to the
               fore. Manufacturers at various levels were created to meet those needs.
                A handful of such emerging manufacturers have also made it possible for
                 their customers to purchase their products online. Here are several 
                 manufacturers who have achieved a reputation in the last few years.</p>

      <p>This is their story. Ecokade was founded by mr.Munsif and his wife Saara. Their
          headquarters located in Rodrigo Lane, Dehiwala, 10350 , Srilanka. Eco kade is
           an independent, environmentally sustainable and ethical business that carefully
            provides Sri Lanka with inexpensive and well-crafted zero-waste goods. They
             invite you to raise awareness of the effect of discarded plastics on our
              health and habitats by EcoCade and to embark with them on a zero-waste 
              journey.It can be a challenging challenge in Sri Lanka to get plastic-free
               goods in one location, and they hope the Eco Kadé online store can be the
                response to your concerns. From kitchen goods to personal items and baby 
                items, they have a wide range of plastic-free products. Eco Kadé is the
                 place to shop if you are interested in moving to a more healthy lifestyle!
                 .Eco-Cade is more than just a online market that offers plastic free items.
                  They want to foster a culture instead. A group that, by reforestation
                   initiatives, ocean cleaning and awareness initiatives, and through 
                   swapping disposable plastics for recycled ones, gives back to our 
                   precious environment.</p>
