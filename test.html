            <h1> Eco-friendly products in Sri lanka</h1>

            <p>While developing a country is not a difficult task, think for a moment about
                 how successful it is to develop a country in such a way as to protect the 
                 environment and not harm the environment. That's why we consider 
                  Sustainability as one of the most challenging lifestyle concepts to follow. 
                  But it is important that we prioritize that concept. we must remember that
                   we can protect ourselves if we protect the environment too. Today, many 
                   companies as well as manufacturers in various fields are embracing the 
                   concept of eco-friendliness. As a result, it is expected that many
                    eco-friendly products will be available in the market in Sri Lanka in the
                     future. Among the products that can be expected are eco-friendly fashion
                      products, decorative products, home appliances, kitchen appliances,
                      Presumably, stationery, as well as eco-friendly buildings, will be
                       popular. It can also be concluded that the focus is more on renewable
                        energy products. We hope to see a greener Sri Lanka free of plastic
                         and polythene in the future by creating alternatives to plastic and
                          polythene and preventing them from harming the environment.

                    goods. While they might appear more costly, many of these products last
                     longer and provide some advantages over other products, such as'</p>

             <p id="healthp"> Eco-friendly goods and green buildings are safe because the components used
                  do not contain toxic additives or ingredients. People are happy to realize
                   that they need not subject themselves to the toxic elements caused by
                    emissions. Environmentally friendly products and green buildings do not
                     use plastic by-products which release toxic substances.

                    artificial lighting usage is reduced and energy is saved.</p>

            <h1>how to choose the best eco-products </h1>
            <br>
            <P>You want to choose the right items for the health of your family, and you need 
                them to be successful. If the product does not do the job it was intended to
                 do, it does not really matter if the product appears to be environmentally 
                 friendly. Some forms of labeling show whether the brand is actually 
                 environmentally conscious or merely as a marketing tactic using natural
                  ingredient statements. By selling products made with natural products and 
                  additives, many businesses are misleading customers. These label forms do
                   not promise that the commodity is eco-friendly.Labels to understand
                    include:</P>
            <br>
            <p1>USDA Organic - This seal is used on food and cosmetics for products that
                 are actually organic.</p1>
            <p1>Energy Star - A label used for electronics and appliances showing the product
                 will provide energy-saving benefits.</p1>
            <p1>Green Seal - Used on cleaning products, if it has the green seal, it's an
                 eco-friendly product</p1>
            <p1>Forest Stewardship Council Logo - This logo is used for eco-friendly wood 
                and paper products.</p1>
